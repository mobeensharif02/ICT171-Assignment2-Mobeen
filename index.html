        <h4 class="card-title">Phishing Attacks</h4>
        <p class="card-text">Never click on suspicious links or attachments in emails. Always verify the sender and be cautious of urgent language. Phishing attacks often mimic legitimate institutions such as banks, government agencies, or online services to trick users into revealing sensitive information like passwords and credit card details. Learning to identify red flags in emails—such as misspellings, unexpected attachments, or mismatched URLs—can help you avoid becoming a victim.</p>

        <h4 class="card-title">Password Hygiene</h4>
        <p class="card-text">Use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible. Consider using a password manager. Reusing passwords across sites is dangerous—if one account is breached, all others using the same credentials become vulnerable. A good password manager can generate complex, unique passwords for every service you use and store them securely, so you only have to remember one master password.</p>

        <h4 class="card-title">Privacy Settings</h4>
        <p class="card-text">Review app permissions, social media visibility, and share personal data cautiously. Adjusting privacy settings can limit who can see your posts, location, and personal details. Be mindful of mobile apps that request unnecessary access to your data and regularly audit what information you are sharing with third parties. Awareness of these settings can protect you from identity theft and profiling.</p>
